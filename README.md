Python-nmap implementation for CSSS IA1


We have compared using sockets and python-nmap library for scanning various ports. 


Sockets method allows us to check which ports on an address are open. Although, it does not provide any other information about those ports which are closed.


To overcome this, we used the python-nmap library. This allows us to see more detailed information on a range of ports selected on a particular address such as open, closed, filtered etc.


All comments have been mentioned in the scripts for better understanding of the implementation.
